# CBC360 - Educational Transformation Platform

🎓 **Week 8 Capstone Project - MERN Stack Application**

CBC360 is a comprehensive educational platform designed to support Kenya's transition from the 8-4-4 education system to the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). This platform serves as a bridge between educational policy and classroom implementation, empowering teachers and supporting students across all 47 counties in Kenya.

## 🌟 Project Overview

**Problem Statement**: Kenya's transition to CBC curriculum has created a gap between policy implementation and practical classroom delivery. Teachers need comprehensive training, resources, and ongoing support to successfully implement the new curriculum.

**Solution**: CBC360 provides a unified platform offering teacher training, learning resources, student support programs, and policy updates to ensure successful CBC implementation nationwide.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/
├── components/           # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/              # Basic UI elements (buttons, cards, forms)
│   └── layout/          # Layout components (navbar, footer)
├── pages/               # Route-based page components
├── hooks/               # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                 # Utility functions
└── types/               # TypeScript type definitions
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Component-First Architecture**: Modular, reusable components for maintainability
2. **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety for robust development
3. **Custom Hook Pattern**: Separation of business logic from UI components
4. **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive design prioritizing mobile users
5. **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting and lazy loading implementation
